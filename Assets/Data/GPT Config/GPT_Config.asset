  gameBackground: "Every player shares Megabike in a cartoonish grassland setting.
    Each agent including the human participant makes independent decisions about
    \u201Cpedaling direction\u201D and \u201Cpower,\u201D which are then aggregated
    to determine the bike\u2019s movement. Pedaling at higher strength depletes stamina
    more quickly, encouraging strategic trade-offs between selfish and team-oriented
    actions (adapted from our prior Megabike work). Colored loot boxes appear on
    the map; only the agent whose color matches the loot box can claim it to replenish
    stamina. If the player\u2019s desired loot box lies off the team\u2019s current
    trajectory, they face a dilemma: maintain group cohesion or break away for personal
    gain. "
  votingPrompt: "However, after a while a threatening monster (\u201COwdi\u201D)
    crashes into the bike, and the game declares that one sacrifice is required to
    save the team. Each agent\u2014including the human\u2014casts a public vote to
    choose who will be sacrificed and must provide a brief reason. "
